      <description>The last remaining significant bug, and also the very first GitHub issue, is a JWT compatibility problem. All the implementations use the same authentication API, so hypothetically they should be able to use each other&amp;rsquo;s JWT auth tokens. When I added the ability to switch the implementation in the UI, I tested that each implementation worked in isolation. However, sometimes when switching implementations, you would be spontaneously logged out. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a huge problem as you can simply log in again, so I decided (correctly) that it would be a PITA to solve, and filed an issue to deal with it later.</description>

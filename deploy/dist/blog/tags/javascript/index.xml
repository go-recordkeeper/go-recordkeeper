      <description>The motivating pain point for filing the Mobile UX issue was click-and-drag on mobile. In fact, the major pain point with recording games on OGS was fat fingering inputs on my phone, so it&amp;rsquo;s honestly embarrassing that the issue has been around this long.
The problem is that using a mouse fires different DOM input events than using a finger on a touch screen. I was able to easily develop and work with the mouse events because that&amp;rsquo;s how my dev machine worked, but when I was originally writing the board code I didn&amp;rsquo;t bother hooking up my phone.</description>

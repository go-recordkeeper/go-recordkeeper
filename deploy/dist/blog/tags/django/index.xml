      <title>Debugging JWT</title>

      <description>The last remaining significant bug, and also the very first GitHub issue, is a JWT compatibility problem. All the implementations use the same authentication API, so hypothetically they should be able to use each other&amp;rsquo;s JWT auth tokens. When I added the ability to switch the implementation in the UI, I tested that each implementation worked in isolation. However, sometimes when switching implementations, you would be spontaneously logged out. This isn&amp;rsquo;t a huge problem as you can simply log in again, so I decided (correctly) that it would be a PITA to solve, and filed an issue to deal with it later.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;ve been leaving a mess in my wake as I&amp;rsquo;ve been pushing through the Haskell and Rust implementations, so it&amp;rsquo;s time to pay down some technical debt. Fortunately the GitHub issue tracker has been a useful place to dump problems I didn&amp;rsquo;t want to deal with in the moment, so at least I had an angle of attack.
API Cleanup X/Y &amp;gt; Index For a while now, I&amp;rsquo;ve been suffering from some data modeling gotcha&amp;rsquo;s that are sort of a generally hard problem.</description>

      <title>Monorepo</title>

      <description>I bit the bullet and coallesced all the repositories into a single monorepo: go-recordkeeper. This looks less impressive, in the GitHub organization view, but is generally much nicer to work with. I left the old repositories there just to avoid breaking all those links, so I guess the trail of corpses is still imposing.
RIP git submodules ðŸ˜­
Monorepofication The conversion process was rather lengthy and quite involved. I hope that my case was abnormally difficult because I had a lot of submodules that needed conversion into relative paths, but I cringe to think how much harder it would have been with more coworkers, possibly committing work at the same time.</description>

      <description>bad submodules :&#39;( I have come to discover that git submodules are not the be-all and end-all, tragically. I&amp;rsquo;m using them in goban-server-test to reference the various goban-server implementations, and it works fine when testing stuff on main. It sadly does not work well for testing local unco,mitted code. It is possible to set up a local directory as a git remote, set up a branch for local development, iteratively commit changes, and then pull them inside the submodule, but it&amp;rsquo;s not easy and it&amp;rsquo;s certainly not fun.</description>

      <description>I&amp;rsquo;m back from vacation and it&amp;rsquo;s time to get testing. I need a test harness that can verify any goban-server implementation is correct. Every test should be run against a real service with a real database behind it.
The plan I already have one and a half goban-server implementations written in python and deployed with docker-compose. Therefore,
 Services being tested are started/stopped using docker-compose. Tests are written in Python+pytest.  Unfortunately, this has some corolaries:</description>

      <title>State of the App</title>

      <description>Before I get into the technical details of the new apps I&amp;rsquo;m building, it would be helpful to describe the reference implementation, you know, for reference.
The app, in a nutshell Go Recordkeeper is a relatively simple Single Page Application. You can:
 Log in + Sign up Create new records See/edit your old records Add/undo moves in a record Review the moves played in a record Download .sgf files containing records  The intended user is of course me, but I wanted to add a proper auth flow and support multiple users so that anyone who wants to use it, can.</description>

      <description>I bit the bullet and coallesced all the repositories into a single monorepo: go-recordkeeper. This looks less impressive, in the GitHub organization view, but is generally much nicer to work with. I left the old repositories there just to avoid breaking all those links, so I guess the trail of corpses is still imposing.

I hope that my case was abnormally difficult because I had a lot of submodules that needed conversion into relative paths, but I cringe to think how much harder it would have been with more coworkers, possibly committing work at the same time.</description>

The app, in a nutshell Go Recordkeeper is a relatively simple Single Page Application. You can:
 Log in + Sign up Create new records See/edit your old records Add/undo moves in a record Review the moves played in a record Download .sgf files containing records  The intended user is of course me, but I wanted to add a proper auth flow and support multiple users so that anyone who wants to use it, can.</description>

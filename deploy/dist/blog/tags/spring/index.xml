      <description>Done and dusted. I confess that using Spring was not very inspiring. I did not have very fond memories of it, and now that seems justified. Kotlin was pretty neat though, considering that it&amp;rsquo;s constrained by running on the JVM.
Spring In fairness, Spring is very mature and has decades of layers and growth. It is capable of doing everything, and I assume that if I had grown along with it and had some knowledge of its expectations, I would have had a nicer time.</description>

 Request handling (obviously), with parameters and serialization/deserialization Password hashing JWT key signing SQL querying Configuration from environment variables  Request handling This was pretty easy.</description>

      <description>Before I get into the technical details of the new apps I&amp;rsquo;m building, it would be helpful to describe the reference implementation, you know, for reference.
The app, in a nutshell Go Recordkeeper is a relatively simple Single Page Application. You can:
 Log in + Sign up Create new records See/edit your old records Add/undo moves in a record Review the moves played in a record Download .sgf files containing records  The intended user is of course me, but I wanted to add a proper auth flow and support multiple users so that anyone who wants to use it, can.</description>

      <description>I like to play the board game Go. Personally, I find that Go is more conversational than adversarial. You and your opponent will both have ideas and opinions, you&amp;rsquo;ll ask each other questions, find surprising answers, be refuted or vindicated. Of course, at the end of the game someone wins, but that&amp;rsquo;s just the topic; for me, the joy is in the discussion.
After finishing a game, it&amp;rsquo;s sometimes nice to Go over the highlights with your opponent, or use an AI to get the &amp;ldquo;objectively&amp;rdquo; right answers.</description>

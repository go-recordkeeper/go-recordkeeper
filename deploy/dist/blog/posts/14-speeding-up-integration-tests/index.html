            <h2 id="hiatus-other-projects">Hiatus: other projects</h2>
<p>It&rsquo;s been a hot minute! I&rsquo;ve been working on a few different projects for the last month:</p>
<ul>
<li><strong><a href="https://adventofcode.com/2022">Advent of Code</a></strong> (my <a href="https://github.com/dchiquito/advent-of-code-2022">solutions</a>)</li>
<li><strong><a href="https://github.com/dchiquito/configurator">configurator</a></strong>, a CLI tool for corralling system configuration files into a repository. It makes it much less painful to coordinate configs between multiple machines, especially:</li>
<li><strong>Setting up <a href="https://neovim.io/">Neovim</a>.</strong> Ultimately, I&rsquo;m not that impressed.</li>
</ul>
<h3 id="neovim-pros-and-cons">Neovim: pros and cons</h3>
<p>My <a href="https://github.com/dchiquito/configurations/blob/main/home/.config/nvim/init.lua"><code>init.lua</code></a> is still a work in progress, but nvim now does almost all the things that VSCode does.</p>
<ul>
<li>The level of configurability feels much more granular, and configuration is done imperatively rather than declaratively, which feels more powerful.</li>
<li>It feels cool using the keyboard to do everything, but I don&rsquo;t know that it&rsquo;s necessarily faster, considering how many VSCode shortcuts I already use.</li>
</ul>
<p>On the other hand:</p>
<ul>
<li>neovim is definitely much less intuitive, and all the vim-specific and personalized keybindings mean that any habits I build aren&rsquo;t going to transfer to anywhere else.</li>
<li>Setting it up was a multi-week endeavor, and things still aren&rsquo;t seamless:
<ul>
<li>Python formatting isn&rsquo;t happening</li>
<li>The Python LSP doesn&rsquo;t recognize the poetry virtual environment</li>
<li>Treesitter causes an error whenever a buffer is closed</li>
<li>I just tried to add a word to the spellcheck dictionary and it threw an error.</li>
<li>There are still staple plugins that I haven&rsquo;t gotten around to trying out yet.</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
<p>It&rsquo;s nice that all the guts are exposed and there is definitely a solution to every possible problem, but it&rsquo;s really painful that things don&rsquo;t just work out of the box.</p>
<h2 id="chatgpt-haskell-master">ChatGPT, Haskell Master</h2>
<p>Anyway, with the help of <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/ChatGPT">ChatGPT</a> I was able to stabilize the Haskell implementation a bit. I needed a bit of general direction to get off the ground which I would normally ask a subject-matter expert for, but in lieu of that, ChatGPT was very helpful. It provided pretty accurate code snippets that demonstrated standard library features I didn&rsquo;t know about, it helped identify sources of errors that I couldn&rsquo;t fathom, and it even recognized code that broke with different versions of the same library. It wasn&rsquo;t perfectly knowledgeable of all things, but it was enough to get me unstuck.</p>
<h2 id="integration-testing-improvements">Integration testing improvements</h2>
<p>With some very rudimentary Haskell code written, I wanted to start testing it in the integration testing harness. Tragically, the current suite took a full minute to run, which is honestly rather atrocious. As you may recall from previous blog posts, test data was created by <strong>(1)</strong> using <code>subprocess</code> to invoke <strong>(2)</strong> a <code>manage.py</code> script using the poetry shell, which ran <strong>(3)</strong> some fixture-specific Django ORM code which creates the data. Test cleanup was accomplished similarly.</p>
<p>A minute is too long for 16 tests. After some soul-searching I found that all the fixtures were doing was possible using existing API endpoints, so I just replaced all of that subprocess code with API calls. Every DB row insert went from ~1 second to 0.15 seconds, which really adds up when each test generally needs at least a user and a record.</p>
<p>I also replaced the <code>manage.py</code> script that was being used to reset the database with some raw SQL which accomplishes the same thing. It requires that <code>psql</code> be installed on the client machine, but I&rsquo;m realistically the only person who will ever run these tests, and it&rsquo;s really really fast, so that&rsquo;s all right.</p>
<p>I previously expounded on the benefits of direct DB access, and I think there are still valid points there. I think the fastest possible solution would be invoking the Django ORM models directly in the test environment, but that requires a Django app context which is its own kettle of fish. If I ever need finer control over the DB than the API can provide, I will need to finally figure that out.</p>
<p>The only really impactful way to speed up tests more is to parallelize them. <code>pytest</code> doesn&rsquo;t support that out of the box and it will likely require some additional care when writing tests since full database resets are no longer an option, so that is a problem for another day.</p>
<h2 id="next-steps">Next steps</h2>
<p>Now that I&rsquo;m feeling unblocked on Haskell I can get it harnessed up with the other integration tests to start slogging away at the implementation work. I got the bare rudiments of a postgres connection working, but actually executing useful queries will involve a lot of research and then a lot of polishing.</p>
<p>While I was grumpy with Haskell I also starting working on the Rust implementation with <a href="https://docs.rs/axum/latest/axum/index.html">axum</a>. I haven&rsquo;t gotten any further than that, but it&rsquo;s a much more familiar environment, so I might start the SQL work there if Haskell proves to be too exhausting.</p>

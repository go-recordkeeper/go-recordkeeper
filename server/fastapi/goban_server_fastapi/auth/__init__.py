"""
User database models, helpers, and REST endpoints.
Because other logical slices of the app also need to access the User model for authentication, this slice is split up into layers.
This helps untangle the import dependency graph, and modularizes what would otherwise be a pretty verbose file.
This should not always be the approach taken, smaller slices only need one file.

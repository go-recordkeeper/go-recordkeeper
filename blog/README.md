A blog recording my experiences taping together this whole mess.

# Installation
You will need to install `hugo` through your package manage or whatever.

You will also need to pull the submodule containing the Hugo theme:
```sh
git submodule init
git submodule update --remote
```

You can now run `hugo` in this directory to build the static resources, or `hugo serve` for a dev server.

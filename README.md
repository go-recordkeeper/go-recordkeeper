An application to record go games.

Try it out at [go.chiquit.ooo](https://go.chiquit.ooo/)!

The project was just migrated to a monorepo, so bear with me while things are under construction.

## Why record go games?

Because I want to review them after I play them.

I wanted a way to record games played in person on my phone, but the apps I tried were hard to use on a touchscreen. This application is built specifically to cater to my needs, which are to record, store, review, and export games. AI review is tragically outside the scope.
